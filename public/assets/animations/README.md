# Animation Assets

This directory contains Lottie animation files (.json and .lottie) for use throughout the application.

To use these animations, import the `LottieAnimation` component and provide the path to the animation file:

```jsx
import { LottieAnimation } from '../components/animations';

<LottieAnimation src="/assets/animations/loading.lottie" />
```

You can download free Lottie animations from:
- [LottieFiles](https://lottiefiles.com/)
- [Icons8](https://icons8.com/animated-icons)
- [lordicon](https://lordicon.com/)

After downloading, place the .json or .lottie files in this directory.
